Everyone knows UC Berkeley is liberal. No-one knows how bad it has actually gotten in this state. It's not so much a "lost cause" as it is a festering cancer that we're already seeing spread like with what happened at Emory University, and more recently UC San Diego as well.</p><p>We can amputate lost causes, but if a cancer spreads, we're done. We'll have much better universities with respectable administrations like Stanford and USC succumb to the hyper progressiveness that spreads around the college-aged demographic like a propagandic plague. Soon, it will spread outside the state. We saw signs of it at Princeton and Yale much earlier on in this election cycle, when the "safe space" movement began.</p>
