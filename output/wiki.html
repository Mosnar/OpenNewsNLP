<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"><p>Chalicotheres (from Greek chalix, "gravel" + therion, "beast") were a group of herbivorous, odd-toed ungulate (perissodactyl) mammals spread throughout North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa during the Middle Eocene to Early Pleistocene subepochs living from 46.2 mya—781,000 years ago, existing approximately 45.519 million years.<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"></p>

<p>They evolved around 46 million years ago from small, forest animals similar to the early horses.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Many chalicotheres, including such animals as Moropus and Chalicotherium, reached the size of a horse.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">By the late Oligocene, they had divided into two groups: one that grazed in open areas and another that was more adapted to woodlands.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">They died out around 781,000 years ago, Nestoritherium being the most recently dated chalicothere.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">Chalicotheres are related to the extinct brontotheres, as well as to modern day horses, rhinoceroses, and tapirs.<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj"></p>

<p>Unlike modern perissodactyls, chalicotheres had long forelimbs and short hind limbs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Consequently, chalicotheres probably moved with most of their weight on their short, strong hind legs.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Their front legs had long, curved claws indicating they knuckle-walked like giant anteaters today.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Fossil remains have shown thick, developed front knuckles, much like gorillas.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It was once thought that the claws were used to dig up roots and tubers, but the wear on the claws and teeth do not suggest that they dug or ate dirt-rich foods such as tubers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">The chalicotheres probably used their claws to strip vegetation from trees and to forage for food.<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj"></p>

<p>Chalicotheres did not have front teeth in their upper jaw, and their back teeth <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">show</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">little</MPQAPOL> wear, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">suggesting</MPQAPOL> that they probably were <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">selective</MPQAPOL> browsers.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">It used its long forearms and curved claws to hook down leafy branches in the wooded savannahs in which it lived.<MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj"></p></MPQASENT>
