<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Russia's ambassador to NATO accused the U.S. Wednesday of trying to intimidate Moscow by sailing a Navy destroyer in the Baltic Sea, and vowed Russia would respond to future incidents with "all necessary measures."</MPQASENT>
 
<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Alexander Grushko spoke following a meeting of the NATO-Russia council in Brussels, the first in nearly two years.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj" id="3">The meeting, which involved Grushko and ambassadors from NATO's 28 member states, ran over its allotted time by about 90 minutes, but produced no major breakthroughs.</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">"It's better to talk than not to talk," Grushko told reporters, before adding that relationships between NATO and Russia would not improve "without real steps on NATO's side to downgrade military activity in the area adjacent to the Russian Federation."</MPQASENT>

<MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Reuters reported that U.S. ambassador to NATO Douglas Lute pressed Grushko about the April 11 incident in which two Russian Su-24 attack aircraft buzzed the USS Donald Cook in the Baltic Sea.</MPQASENT>
